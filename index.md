I am in section A08: Modeling Mental Health with Mobile and Wearable Data. Our mentor is Tauhidur Rahman.

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic we covered came from the first research paper that I read for our literature review. It involved specialized deep learning computer vision models that could segment brain regions in a baby MRI scan much better than the existing models out there. It was cool to learn about how they used transfer learning to modify the architecture of models that are used for adult MRI scans (and used it for this new purpose). I think that was an interesting first look into the applications of ML in the healthcare domain.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

One thing we recently got assigned is to build some computer vision models to detect facial expressions in real time. The goal (subject to change) is to have an app that can observe doctor-patient interactions and determine the mood of the patient during different parts of the conversation. I think it would be great to investigate which deep learning architectures perform best for this task and how we can leverage pre-existing open-source models to build something that has high accuracy.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

Our Q1 project is a bit disorganized as of now, seeing as we just shifted plans because we haven't been able to obtain the orignal dataset we had planned on. But we did get assigned a new task to build/fine-tune CV models for facial expression recognition (as explained in the previous question).

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Apart from using deep learning frameworks to fine-tune our CV models, I'd be interested in using app development frameworks such as Swift or React Native to deploy our models and make them more interactive in an iOS/iPad application. This is one of the goals we discussed in our last meeting with our mentor. But, we have many other ideas that we could end up pursuing as well.
